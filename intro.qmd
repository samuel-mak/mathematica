# Number Theory {.unnumbered}


**Definition

**Number**

- **Definition**
  - A number is a mathematical object primarily used for counting and/or measuring/quantifying some objects
- **Types of number**
  - There are different types of numbers and they mostly exist as units within a hierarchy/subsets of some larger sets based on their properties, hence, they are also referred to as number sets/systems
  - Each type is sometimes denoted by a different symbol due to its significance
  - <details><summary>**Some types of number in hierarchy**</summary>
    - Complex ($\mathbb{C}$)
      - Imaginary
      - Real ($\mathbb{R}$) 
        - Rational ($\mathbb{Q}$) 
          - Integer ($\mathbb{Z}$)
            - Natural ($\mathbb{N}$) 
            - Negative integers
          - Fraction
        - Irrational 
          - Algebraic irrational 
          - Transcendental

**Natural Numbers**

- **Introduction**
  - Natural numbers are a set of numbers that is considered to be the most basic/primitive type of numbers (i.e. being the lowest level in the number type hierarchy)
  - Aka "counting numbers" 
- **Conceptual Definition**
  - $\mathbb{N} = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$
    - ***Notes*** 
      - Historically, natural numbers have been defined as all positive integers ($1, 2, 3, ...$), which means that zero has been excluded as zero wasn't conceptualized as a number. In more recent times, zero is generally considered as a number, hence, natural numbers are defined as all non-negative integers ($0, 1, 2, 3, ...$), hence, they are also known as that. People using the former definition includes Michael Spivak [@spivak08] while those using the latter definition includes Terence Tao [@tao16]
