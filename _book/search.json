In more recent times, zero is generally considered as a number, hence, natural numbers are defined as all non-negative integers (\\(0, 1, 2, 3, ...\\)), hence, they are also known as that. People using the former definition includes Michael Spivak (Spivak, 2008) while those using the latter definition includes Terence Tao (Tao, 2016)\n\n\n\nMathematical definition\n\nThe Peano axioms\n\nIntroduction\n\nPeano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpivak, M.
